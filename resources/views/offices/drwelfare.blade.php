                            A community that does not make the welfare of its members a priority is seemingly a dead one.
                            In this regards, there is a provision for an Office for a Welfare Director, <b>an individual whose
                            constant desire is the well-being of all Adekunle Ajasin University Students,</b> and particularly
                            has the duty of being responsible for all matters relating to the general welfare of Union members
                            and guests.
                            <br><br>
                            Alongside the above mentioned, the Union's <b>"Number Seven"</b> also has a duty to facilitate meetings
                            that will ensure peaceful coexistence between the Students and the hosting communities, measuring
                            the capability of a worthwhile leader.
