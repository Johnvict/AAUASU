                            In a "21st Century University Properly Called", the need for proper documentation is a dire need
                            to the Union, such that a Union with intellectual capacity would be efficient in its struggle.
                            <br><br>
                            The General Secretary serves as the third citizen of the Union, <b>The powerful pen handler,</b> the
                            one to whom all correspondence is directed. Apart from being an outstanding student as the others,
                            the General Secretary is desired an intellectually and psychologically sound individual due to the
                            sensitivity of his office.<br><br>
                            Apart from his personality features, he performs his Secretariat duty in all SEC meetings as well
                            as in Congress Meetings.
