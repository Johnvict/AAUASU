                        and maintained, the Union takes as its priority, <b>Accountability and Efficiency</b> in its financial
                        dealings. Hence, the need for a capable Financial Secretary who keeps records of all Union's Financial
                        Statements.<br><br>
                        As a pride to the Union, the Financial Statements are not only recorded, but by the responsibility of
                        the Financial Secretary, such Financial Statements are published to all notice boards on campus
                        for the perusal of all students, which signifies the open-running of the Union Finances.
