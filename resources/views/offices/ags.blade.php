                            The purpose of the Union would be uncredited without proper documentation, especially when needed.
                            Yet, the Secretariat work of the Union majors to bring about an effective documentation which in
                            the 21st century world is of great importance. The Union, however in this regards provides for the
                            need of an Assistant General Secretary, to assist the intellectual and prowess of the  General Secretary,
                            ensuring a fast-moving Students Union that agitates for the rights and justification of Students on
                            campus.

                            Traditional in some places, but constitutional for AAUASU, the Union's <b>"Number Ten"</b> provides
                            identity card for all Union's Officers.
